This web-based experience displays a grid of endangered species from the IUCN Red Listâ€”clicking on a species reveals information about it and pauses an ongoing countdown, but closing the window triggers a low alarm tone as the species disappears from view. Every ten seconds, another species vanishes, announced by the tone, unless the user interacts.",
