    "summary": "Centred around unique letterforms generated by a neural network trained on translations of the word \"bloom\" collected from the Central Saint Martins community, the identity combines dynamic imagery and vibrant colours to form a generative visual system that evolves to mirror the students' journey of growth and transformation.",
    "full": [
      "Bloom embodies the individual and collective growth of the Central Saint Martins graduating class during a time marked by global dispersion and isolation, where the profound importance of the human connections that form the heart of the university community was thrown into stark relief.",
      "The institution’s rich, pluralistic culture is reflected through a multilingual approach, inviting students and staff to contribute translations of the word \"bloom\" in their native languages. These diverse translations were then used to train a neural network, which generated new letterforms across a wide spectrum of visual possibilities. By exploring the latent space of this network, the resulting outputs reveal vibrant pathways of learning, creativity, and personal growth.",
      "Bloom represents both a celebration of growth and a testament to the resilience of the Central Saint Martins community. By embracing the plurality of voices and experiences through a generative, adaptive design process, this visual identity becomes an evolving representation of the student journey—a journey of becoming, making, and blooming."
