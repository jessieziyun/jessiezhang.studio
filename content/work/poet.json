    "summary": "Responding to touch and care, the plant creates poetry, weaving a narrative that explores the delicate interplay between human and non-human life. Through technology, this project cultivates a space for coexistence and communication across species, inviting a deeper understanding of our shared existence.",
    "full": [
      "What would it be like to live in a world where plants are equal participants in human society? The Poet presents a vision of cohabitation, where technology acts as a mediator, fostering a closer relationship between humans and non-human nature",
      "Blurring the line between the organic and the digital, the installation allows a plant to communicate its state through poetry—a living language generated by a neural network. As the plant is nurtured, its poetry evolves, becoming more cohesive, expressive, and lyrical. When neglected, the poems fragment, mirroring its decline in well-being.",
      "Data from sensors measuring soil moisture, light, temperature, and human touch influences the tone, structure, and flow of each verse. The more care the plant receives, the richer the poem’s composition, creating a feedback loop of connection. The visual presentation also adapts: letterforms and colour gradients bloom with attentive care, while neglect results in more restrained, disordered shapes and muted tones.",
      "At its heart, The Poet challenges the traditional roles assigned to nature and technology. Plants are no longer silent objects but collaborators—cohabitants in an evolving dialogue. By engaging directly with the plant’s needs, The Poet asks its audience to reconsider the boundaries between human and non-human life, encouraging a sense of responsibility and reciprocity. Technology becomes a tool not for domination, but for fostering symbiotic relationships, where interaction benefits both human and plant."
